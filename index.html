		    <h5 class="card-title">Tetris</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">
		    	Tetris is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.
		    	In Tetris, players must complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.

		    <p class="card-text">
		    	Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle.
		    	The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves.
